We use simulations to better understand the performance of optical CNNs. \\

 Introduce toy classification problem(s?), discuss constraints.

\subsection{Learned Optical Correlator}
For our first experiment, we simulated a system with a single optical convolutional layer to confirm that our proposed optical convolution layer would function as expected. A single convolutional layer is essentially an optical correlator.  

Here we are able to use end-to-end learning. \\

While this was interesting, optical correlator is not powerful enough for more difficult classification tasks, for example with natural images or with more categories. Also, with a single layer, it was not necessarily a CNN.

\subsection{Hybrid optoelectronic CNN} 
Next we keep one optical convolutional layer but add on more after.

\subsection{Fully optical CNN} 
Doesnâ€™t fully work, but can discuss some results
