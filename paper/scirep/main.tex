\section*{Introduction}
% The Introduction section, of referenced text\cite{Figueredo:2009dg} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

\section*{Discussion}
% The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.
\label{sec:discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item Not straightforward to generalize first optical conv. layer to multiple optical layers
\item Discuss importance of negative weights â€“ \red{Vincent?}
\item Instead of trying to replicate a CNN exactly, could take advantage of optical transformations that aren't as practical in computations. For example, we use a 4f system for convolution, but this requires two extra lenses. Perhaps a single custom learned optical element can be used instead.
\item In the future, exploit other properties of light (polarization, phase)	
\item Specifically, coherent light and holography, photonics
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methods}
% Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work.
\subsection*{Training}
Models were trained in Tensorflow.

\subsection*{Phase mask fabrication}
Phase masks were fabricated via multilayer lithography.

\subsection*{Optical prototype}
Laser light was scrambled through a rotating diffuser and illuminated a DMD. Images were relayed through a 4$f$ system consisting of two convex $f = 200$ mm lenses. Images were captured by a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0).
